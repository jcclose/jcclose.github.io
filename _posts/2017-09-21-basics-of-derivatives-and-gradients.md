The linked [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/ResourceHog/MLS-Training-Sessions/blob/master/NN/Session_1/Derivative_Gradient_Review.ipynb) walks through the basics of the derivative function. It builds on that knowledge to implement hill descent for optimizing a single parameter model and gradient descent for optimizing a multidimensional model. Matplotlib plots bring the explanations to life and modifiable code makes for a hands-on learning experience. Below are some screenshots to give you an idea of the content.
